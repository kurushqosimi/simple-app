# Gin + Gorm + Redis: High-Performance API Setup

## Overview
Gin is a high-performance HTTP web framework in Go, ideal for creating RESTful APIs.  
Gorm is a Go ORM library, providing a high-level interface for interacting with databases.  
Redis is used as a caching layer to reduce the load on the database by storing frequently accessed data in memory.

## Objectives
1. Set up a basic API structure with **Gin**.
2. Use **Gorm** to connect to a database and handle CRUD operations.
3. Add **Redis** caching to improve API performance.
4. Explain each component, design, and benefits.

## Prerequisites
- **Go** installed
- **Redis** installed
- **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** database for persistence

## Why Use Each Component?

### Gin
- **Lightweight and efficient** – great for building APIs.
- Provides **helpful middleware** and a **convenient routing** mechanism.
- High performance for both small and large projects.

### Gorm
- Manages interactions with the database, eliminating the need for raw SQL.
- Provides a **cleaner codebase** and easier **maintenance**.
- Offers **migrations**, **relationships**, and powerful features out of the box.

### Redis
- Serves as a **caching layer** to store frequently accessed data in memory.
- **Reduces the number of queries** to the database.
- Significantly **improves performance** for read-heavy endpoints.

## Benefits of This Architecture
- **Layered structure**: Separates concerns into clear layers (controllers, services, repositories) — easier to maintain and test.
- **Caching**: Improves response times and reduces database load.
- **Configuration management**: Centralized configuration (`config` package) allows changing settings without modifying core logic.

This setup is now a **modular, high-performance API** that can handle large loads effectively while remaining **simple** and **maintainable**.
